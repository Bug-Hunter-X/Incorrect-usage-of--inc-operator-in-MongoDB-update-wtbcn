# Incorrect Usage of $inc Operator in MongoDB Update

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The error occurs when attempting to increment a numeric field using a string value instead of a number. This leads to the update operation failing silently without any error message, resulting in data inconsistency.  The solution provides the correct way to use the `$inc` operator and handle potential errors.

## Bug

The primary issue lies in the incorrect usage of the `$inc` operator within a MongoDB update operation.  Using a string value ('1') instead of a numeric value (1) for the increment prevents the update from working as intended.

## Solution

The solution shows the correct usage of the `$inc` operator where the increment value is a number, ensuring the intended result of incrementing the `count` field.  Furthermore, error handling is included to catch potential exceptions and provide informative feedback.
